# Calculator
This desktop calculator application was built using Python and Tkinter library. It can do arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, decimal points and parentheses.

While doing this project, I gained the experience in handling mathematical expression by converting symbols like “x” and “÷” into readable operators and using eval() to evaluate the results. I also learned how to handle more advanced input logic, such as managing balanced parentheses and implementing backspace and clear function.
